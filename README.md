# ESP8266EZClock
Welcome.
This is my very first project I upload to Github and im open to any critisism and suggestions for improvement

So this is a project running a TM1637 4 digit 7 segment display on an ESP8266.
I want to keep this project as easy to understand so even a rookie can work on it.
The DST happens automaticly and it contains WiFi Manager as well.
You should be able to find a binary for the esp8266 to just flash with Europe/Berlin timezone, in case you just want to use it.

Im working on this and if there is anything you miss or something, donÂ´t hasitate to contact me directly on discord Neojunky#0815
Props to the EZTimeLib and the TM1637

Planned in the future to add a webserver, where you can change basic settings like time format and timezone.
